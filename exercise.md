Goals for today:

## Updating DOM with 3rd party data on DOM load 

1. We are going to render data from a 3rd party API upon a document load
2. Return the 5 most recently created breweries



## Searching 3rd party API's 

1. We are going to create a form for a user to input a search term
2. When the form is submitted, we will fetch data with the query term from a third party api 
3. Once data is received we will append to the DOM 
4. We will update the DOM on every search submission
